This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic fashion images using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model consists of a CNN-based generator and discriminator, trained using PyTorch to learn the underlying patterns of clothing items. By leveraging batch normalization, LeakyReLU, and Adam optimization, the DCGAN progressively improves, generating realistic-looking fashion images.
